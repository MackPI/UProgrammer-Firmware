# UProgrammer-Firmware
Firmware for universal programmer based on ESP-12E and Espressif API

Version  00B

This version is testing basic understanding of the API, and file structure.
Created a simple serial menu in the file simple_serial.c.  The new code puts up a simple menu, accepts input, and displays current connection status.

The code is very poorly documented and a only few helper functions have been abstracted.
