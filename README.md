# UProgrammer-Firmware
Firmware for universal programmer based on ESP-12F and Espressif API

Version  00K

There is a menu that works over the serial port at 115200 baud

This version is a cleaned up version edited to make it easier to read and maintain the code.
Indentation style is Allman

I have attempted to make the code self documenting.  It still needs significant comments where hardware registers are accessed directly.
